Problem: You place the result of an expression in a local variable for later use in your code.

Solution: 
- Move the entire expression to a separate method and return the result from it. 
- Query the method instead of using a variable. 
- Incorporate the new method in other methods, if necessary.

Goals: reuse logic to all method from local variable logic
